## Meta Agent fork

This directory is a local fork of [`ranxianglei/billion-context-pi`](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context-pi) for Meta Agent Desktop. For local Desktop testing, use **Settings > Extensions > Developer Mode > Add local extension** and select this directory; the entry is `index.ts`.

The fork is not registered with Desktop automatically. Desktop keeps `pi-subagents` as the only subagent orchestrator; when this extension is approved in a Desktop session, it opts into the same approved child sessions for ACP context tools. Set `autoUpdate: false` in Desktop to prevent runtime npm checks and replacement.

## Why?

When conversations get long, the model runs out of context. Most tools hard-truncate — silently dropping earlier messages. **billion-context** gives the model a `compress` tool: the LLM decides **when** and **what** to compress into high-fidelity summaries, preserving critical details (file paths, decisions, error strings) while reclaiming context space.

Unlike Pi's built-in auto-compaction (which replaces everything with a single summary), billion-context:
- **Preserves structure** — compressed ranges become labeled blocks you can decompress later
- **Multi-tier** — summaries can be further distilled (T1 → T2 → T3) as sessions grow
- **Searchable** — `search_context` finds information inside compressed blocks without decompressing
- **Selective** — protected tools, user messages, and the recent working set are never compressed

This means:

1. **A single session handles enormous workloads.** Per simulation tests of the three-tier architecture (see [opencode-acp](https://github.com/ranxianglei/opencode-acp)), one session can process on the order of 10–60 billion cumulative tokens — while retaining long-term memory of distant key information (paths, decisions, signatures). You can work in the **same session for months** without outgrowing the context.
2. **Context stays lean over the long run.** In practice context typically holds under ~150K tokens (opencode-acp keeps it under ~200K), so compared to traditional compaction that lets context balloon toward 1M, **a single session costs roughly 5× less in tokens**.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:billion-context-pi
```

That's it. The extension auto-loads on next Pi startup. No configuration needed — it reads your model's context window automatically.

## How it works

billion-context intercepts Pi's `context` event (fired before each LLM call) and runs an 8-stage pipeline:

```
assign refs → sync blocks → prune → filter → hide calls → recommend → nudge → emergency truncate
```

Each message gets an invisible `<acp>` ref tag (`m00001`, `m00002`, ...) visible to the model but not the user. The model uses these refs to specify compression ranges.

Pi's built-in auto-compaction is cancelled — billion-context is the sole context manager.

## Plugin compatibility & ordering

billion-context takes over context management by intercepting Pi's `context` event. **Pi has no plugin priority mechanism** — when multiple extensions register handlers for the same event, they run in a fixed sequence (load order), with no `priority`/`weight` field and no way for the user to control the order. The `context` event specifically is a *pipeline*: every handler receives the previous handler's output, there is no short-circuit, and the **last** handler has the final say over what reaches the model.

This has two practical implications:

1. **Keep exactly one context-compression plugin installed.** If you run two compression plugins together (e.g. billion-context-pi alongside another), both will rewrite the message list and clobber each other's work — compressed ranges can be re-expanded or corrupted. Pi's built-in auto-compaction is already cancelled automatically by billion-context-pi, but any *third-party* compression/compaction extension should be uninstalled.

2. **Even with a single compression plugin, interference is still possible in rare cases.** Load order under Pi is determined by filesystem discovery order (`fs.readdirSync` over `.pi/extensions/` → global → packages), which is not fully deterministic. If another (non-compression) extension also hooks the `context` event and happens to load *after* billion-context-pi, it could modify the compressed output. billion-context-pi rebuilds its working set from the session log rather than the chained input, which makes it robust to handlers that run *before* it — but it cannot defend against a handler that runs *after* it. This is a limitation of Pi's extension model; if you observe unexpected context behavior, check whether other installed extensions intercept the `context` event.

## Model-facing tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `compress` | Replace a contiguous message range with a detailed summary |
| `decompress` | Restore a previously compressed block's content |
| `search_context` | Search compressed block summaries (and visible messages) by keyword |
| `acp_status` | Show context usage, compressed blocks, compressible ranges |

### Child context tools

Desktop child sessions explicitly load this extension when it is approved alongside `pi-subagents`. The child receives the four ACP context tools and can compress its own long-running work; `pi-subagents` remains responsible for delegation, lifecycle, permissions, and results.

## Configuration

billion-context-pi works out of the box with no configuration. Standard Pi reads five optional keys from its JSON config file.

### Standard Pi config file

Create `~/.pi/acp.json` (global) and/or `<project>/.pi/acp.json` (project-local, overrides global):

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "modelContextLimit": 200000,
  "toolBashDefaultTimeout": 60,
  "toolOutputMaxBytes": 200000
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `debug` | `false` | Write diagnostic events to `~/.pi/acp-debug.log`. Also enabled by env `ACP_DEBUG=1`. |
| `autoUpdate` | `true` | On Pi startup, check npm for a newer version and auto-install it (throttled to one check per 3 minutes). Disable to avoid all startup network calls. |
| `modelContextLimit` | *(auto)* | Override the context limit (in tokens). Defaults to the model's `contextWindow`. |
| `toolBashDefaultTimeout` | `60` | Seconds injected into the `bash` tool when the model omits `timeout`. Pi has **no** default of its own, so without this a forgotten timeout can hang for thousands of seconds. On timeout the model is guided to re-run with a larger `timeout`. `0` restores Pi's unbounded behavior. |
| `toolOutputMaxBytes` | `200000` | Hard byte cap on tool result text (~5000 lines at ~40 B/line; applied via the `tool_result` hook). Stops runaway output that Pi's own 50KB/2000-line cap can't catch (e.g. tools Pi doesn't cap). When it fires the model is told how to see the full output — for `bash` the full output is in its temp file (`BashToolDetails.fullOutputPath`); set lower (e.g. `8192`) for a tighter context budget, or `0` to disable. |

> **Only these five keys are read from `acp.json`.** Other tuning knobs (`preserveRecentMessages`, `protectedTools`, nudge thresholds) are code-level and not user-overridable.

### Desktop configuration schema

When Desktop loads this directory through Developer Mode or a marketplace artifact, `market-manifest.json` declares a separate five-field schema: `modelContextLimit`, `preserveRecentMessages`, `toolBashDefaultTimeout`, `toolOutputMaxBytes`, and `debug`. Desktop stores these values and passes the effective scalar configuration to the extension through `pi.getConfig()`.

Desktop values take precedence over the same keys in `acp.json` and are applied when the extension worker is reloaded. `preserveRecentMessages` is Desktop-only and defaults to `5`; it is intentionally not read from `acp.json`. Desktop does not expose `autoUpdate` in the schema and the Desktop entry forces update checks off. `ACP_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT` remains the highest-priority context-limit override inside the compression adapter.

The schema source and field rules are documented in the built-in `desktop-plugin-development` skill, under `references/configuration-schema.md`.

> **Only these five keys are read from standard Pi `acp.json`.** Other tuning knobs (`preserveRecentMessages`, `protectedTools`, and nudge thresholds) are not user-overridable there.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `ACP_AUTO_UPDATE` | Set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off` (case-insensitive) to disable auto-update, overriding the config. |
| `ACP_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT` | Override the context limit. Takes precedence over the config value. |
| `ACP_DEBUG` | Set to `1` or `true` to enable debug logging. |

### Compression philosophy

The model receives detailed guidance (in its system prompt) on **when** to compress, **what** to keep verbatim (paths, signatures, errors, decisions, user intent), and **what** to drop (verbose logs, duplicates, consumed exploration). This guidance is injected on every turn so it stays in the model's attention.

### What gets protected

billion-context protects three categories of content from compression:

1. **Always-protected tools** — `compress` calls are hard-protected (they're load-bearing metadata; compressing them breaks decompress and the "summary is historical" contract).
2. **Soft recent-zone** — the last N messages (default 5) and last ~5K tokens are soft-protected so the model keeps its working set. Tool results from `decompress`, `search_context`, `read`, and `bash` are **excluded** from this zone: they're large and meant to be compressible once consumed, so they don't eat the protected budget.
3. **Last user message** — always protected (user intent must survive).

## Built on acp-kernel

The compression engine is [`acp-kernel`](https://github.com/ranxianglei/acp-kernel) — a platform-agnostic, MIT-licensed library with 208 tests. It's bundled inline into `dist/index.js`, so there are zero runtime dependencies.
