# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.3.1

### Added

- **Issue Separators**: `---` horizontal rules between issues within the same severity section for visual breathing room
- **Strengths Suppression Whitelist**: Explicit allowed-sections-only instruction prevents LLM from generating praise under alternate headings
- **Effort/Benefit Inline Rationale**: Each rating now includes nested bullet reasons derived from calibration questions (file count, cross-boundary, hot path, consequence, workaround)

### Changed

- **Effort/Benefit Format**: Replaced single-line `Fix: Effort: X | Benefit: Y` with separate `Effort:` and `Benefit:` lines, each with 1-3 nested reason bullets
- **E/B Section Title**: Renamed from "Fix Effort & Benefit" to "Effort & Benefit" throughout

### Removed

- **Single-line Fix format**: `Fix: Effort: X | Benefit: Y` replaced by multi-line format with rationale

## 1.3.0

### Added

- **Fix Effort & Benefit Analysis**: Each Critical and Important issue includes `Fix: Effort: [L/M/H] | Benefit: [L/M/H]` with step-by-step reasoning guidance to prevent Medium/Medium defaults
- **Severity Classification**: Explicit 2-tier criteria table (Critical vs Important) with clear definitions and examples
- **Review Workflow**: Explicit 8-step sequence (Calibrate → Scope → Language → Review → Classify → Assess → Report → Verdict)
- **Verdict Criteria**: Deterministic "first matching condition" table — same inputs always produce same verdict
- **L3 Fallback**: When user skips positioning, defaults to L3 (Team) with note in report header
- **When to Load References**: Routing table for lazy-loading reference files by context
- **Empty Section Guidance**: Empty severity sections are omitted entirely from the report
- **Expanded Trigger Phrases**: Added "review this PR", "PR review", "code review", "pre-merge check", "code audit", "is this production-ready?", "find bugs", "look at my code", "check for issues"

### Changed

- **Report Formatting**: Bold only on issue title lines; sub-item labels (Rule, Principle, Suggestion, Fix) are now plain text for cleaner TUI readability
- **Go Language**: Enriched description — noted interface-based polymorphism, struct embedding, composition philosophy
- **Paradigm Labels**: "Systems" → "Systems/Composition", "Procedural" → "Procedural/Composition"

### Removed

- **Minor Issues tier (🔵)**: Consolidated to 2-tier severity (Critical + Important). Below-threshold items are not reported — if it's not worth actioning, omit it entirely
- **Strengths section (✅)**: Removed from report template, example, and workflow. Code review is purely problem-focused — no AI sycophancy
- **"Common Mistakes to Avoid" section**: Guidance integrated into workflow and reference loading table
- **"The Bottom Line" section**: Redundant with the explicit Review Workflow
- **Component Principles inline table**: Moved to reference link (`principles-glossary.md`)

## 1.2.0

### Changed

- **Expanded Description Triggers**: Added more natural language triggers ("is this code good?", "check code quality", "ready to merge?", "technical debt", "code smell", "best practices", "clean up code", "refactor review") to improve skill discoverability
- **Leaner SKILL.md**: Moved detailed Strictness Matrix and Metric Thresholds tables to `references/positioning.md`, keeping only quick reference in main skill file (359 → 343 lines)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: SKILL.md now references `positioning.md` for complete matrices, following skill-creator best practices

## 1.1.0

### Added

- **GitHub Actions Release Workflow**: Auto-trigger on `v*` tags, validate skill, generate `.skill` and `.zip` packages
- **Detailed Report Format**: Each issue now includes Rule Name, Principle explanation, and Suggestion
- **Language-aware Warning**: Switch statements section now warns about FP/TS paradigm differences
- **Quick Test for DRY**: Added "If one changes, must the other ALWAYS change?" test for accidental duplication
- **Installation Guide**: Support for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex with verification steps

### Changed

- **Reference Files Reorganization**: Split `reference-manual.md` into 8 focused files:
  - `clean-code.md` (CC-1 to CC-202)
  - `clean-architecture.md` (CA-1 to CA-48)
  - `pragmatic-programmer.md` (PP-1 to PP-100)
  - `principles-glossary.md` (SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, etc.)
  - `principles-spectrum.md` (DRY vs WET guidance)
  - `language-adjustments.md` (per-language rule adjustments)
  - `positioning.md` (3+4+2 questionnaire system)
  - `quick-lookup.md` (symptom → rule lookup)
- **DRY Tolerance Format**: Changed from ambiguous "2×" to explicit "max 2 → report on 3rd occurrence"
- **L1 Test Coverage**: Changed from "0%" to "N/A" for consistency with other L1 metrics
- **60-line Example**: Added "(exemption rationale, not default tolerance)" clarification

### Fixed

- **Code Smells Table**: Removed hardcoded numbers, now references Metric Thresholds
- **CC-75 Invalid Reference**: Changed to CC-22, CC-178 for deep nesting (CC-75 was in skipped Formatting chapter)
- **Parameter Count Inconsistency**: Code Smells now references level thresholds instead of fixed ">3"
- **Function Length Inconsistency**: Code Smells now references level thresholds instead of fixed ">30-50"

### Removed

- `reference-manual.md` (replaced by 8 focused files in `references/`)

## 1.0.1

### Changed

- **Mandatory Project Positioning**: Added prominent "MANDATORY FIRST STEP" section at top of skill
- **Stronger Emphasis**: Use "STOP!" and "DO NOT proceed" language for project positioning requirement

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate positioning question from Step 1

## 1.0.0

### Added

- Initial release of Pragmatic Clean Code Reviewer skill
- **Rule Sources**: 
  - The Pragmatic Programmer (PP-1 to PP-100)
  - Clean Code (CC-1 to CC-202)
  - Clean Architecture (CA-1 to CA-48)
- **3+4+2 Questionnaire System**: Project positioning with L1-L5 strictness levels
- **15-Point Review Checklist**: Comprehensive code review coverage
- **Language-Aware Adjustments**: Rules adapted for Java, Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.
- **Standardized Report Format**: Consistent output with emoji indicators
- **350+ Rules**: Complete reference manual with review points
